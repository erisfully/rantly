      rant. Seriously, all the things are totally awful. I can't even handle it. I just wanna rant about it all
      forever. Thank goodness for Rantly, because I can now actually do said ranting forever and ever and that would
      make me happy if I was capable of that, but I just exist solely for the purpose of ranting.
